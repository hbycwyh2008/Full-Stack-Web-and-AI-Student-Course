# Lesson 6: Pydantic Models and Phase 01 Checkpoint

## Lesson Goal

By the end of this lesson, each student should be able to:

1. Define Pydantic models for request and response bodies.
2. Replace raw dicts with typed schemas on POST/PUT routes.
3. Add a preview `POST /ask` body schema `{ "question": "..." }` (stub answer for now).
4. Validate empty questions with clear 422/400 errors.
5. Pass **course Phase 7 checkpoint**: running app + `/docs` + POST tested.
6. Submit Coursera Module 6 progress, `/docs` screenshot, and Phase 01 checklist.

## Required Resource

Open only the resource named in `Individual Learning`. If the resource is longer than 15 minutes, complete the assigned section in class and finish the rest as homework if your teacher assigns it.

## What to Focus On

Focus on the pattern you need for today's mission. Do not collect extra tutorials during the first learning block.

## Entry Point Check

Use the first 10 minutes to answer these before new instruction:

- What do I already know that connects to today?
- What file, tool, or concept should I open first?
- What is one question I need answered before the mission?

## Individual Learning

> [!NOTE]
> **One required resource** for this block — see below. Do not browse extra playlists during class.

**Required resource — complete Coursera Module 6 (Pydantic Model):**

[Module 6 — Pydantic Model](https://www.coursera.org/learn/packt-introduction-to-fastapi-and-backend-development-fundamentals-7zg6w)

Focus: input/output models, validation rules, response_model, Enums preview.

**Individual notes:**

```text
Pydantic validates...
request model vs response model...
response_model helps because...
My AskRequest fields are...
One thing I still do not understand is...
```

## Talk Robin

**Share:** Why validation before handler runs; example invalid JSON caught by Pydantic.

## Group Answer

```text
We use Pydantic so bad data...
For AI School Assistant, POST /ask will eventually...
Our group still needs help with...
```

## Teacher Clarification

**Teacher checks:** `from pydantic import BaseModel`; students know 422 appears for invalid body.

The teacher explains only the common stuck points before the mission task.

## Mission Task

1. Create `schemas.py` (or models in `main.py`) with:
   - `ProjectCreate`, `ProjectRead`
   - `AskRequest` with `question: str`
   - `AskResponse` with `answer: str`, `source: str | None = None`
2. Refactor project routes to use Pydantic models.
3. Add `POST /ask`: if question empty → HTTPException; else return stub:

   ```json
   {"answer": "Stub: we will connect RAG in course Phase 8.", "source": null}
   ```

4. Add `.env.example` with `OPENAI_API_KEY=your-key-here` (no real key).
5. Commit: `Add Pydantic schemas and stub POST ask`.

## Independent Rebuild

Test invalid body (missing `question`) in `/docs` — confirm validation error. Test valid stub.

**Oral check:** Why must `OPENAI_API_KEY` stay in `.env`, not in frontend?

Close full-solution references before this block. You may use your own short checklist, but do not copy a completed answer.

## Evidence to Submit

1. GitHub link to `schemas.py` / `main.py` and `.env.example`
2. Screenshot of `/docs` showing `POST /ask` success
3. Screenshot of validation error for bad input
4. Coursera Module 6 progress screenshot
5. Phase 01 checklist (below) pasted in Notion or PR description

**Phase 01 checklist:**

```text
[ ] fastapi-backend/ runs with uvicorn
[ ] GET /health works
[ ] CRUD or projects resource works
[ ] POST /ask stub with Pydantic validation
[ ] README documents endpoints
[ ] .env gitignored; .env.example committed
[ ] No secrets in GitHub
```

## Success Criteria

1. Pydantic models used on at least POST routes.
2. `/ask` stub runs with validation.
3. Meets course **C6: FastAPI in `/docs`**.
4. Phase 01 checklist complete.

## Common Problems

| Problem | Try first |
|---|---|
| 422 on valid body | Check field names and types match model. |
| Import errors | `pip install pydantic` (included with FastAPI). |
| `.env` committed | Remove from Git history with teacher help; rotate keys if leaked. |

## Fast Track / Support Track

Fast track:

Continue to [Phase 02 Lesson 7](lesson-07-sql-database-sqlite.md). Lightweight track may stop here and join course Phase 8 RAG.

Support track:

- Complete the smallest working version first.
- Ask for a hint after you can show what you tried.
- Submit honest evidence of progress if the full mission is not finished.
