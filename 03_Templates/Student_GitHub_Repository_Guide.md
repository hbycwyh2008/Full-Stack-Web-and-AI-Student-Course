# Student GitHub Repository Guide

Every student in **Full-Stack Web and AI Application Development** must create and maintain a **personal GitHub repository**. This is separate from the **course repository** (teacher materials). Your repo is your learning evidence.

---

## Repository Name

Choose one:

```text
student-portfolio
```

or:

```text
student-name-full-stack-ai-portfolio
```

Example: `morgan-full-stack-ai-portfolio`

> **Start small.** Build your repository gradually. Phase 0 is only the minimum setup — not the whole course.

---

## Minimum Phase 0 Repository Structure

You do **not** need to create every course folder on day one.

By the end of **Phase 0**, you only need this minimum structure:

```text
student-portfolio/
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── profile/
│   ├── about-me.md
│   └── learning-goals.md
└── reflections/
    └── weekly-reflection-01.md
```

This minimum structure is enough to prove you can:

- create a repository
- write a README
- organize basic folders
- make commits
- use a branch
- open and merge a pull request
- submit a GitHub repo link

Add more folders **later**, when you reach each phase (see [Phase to Folder Mapping](#phase-to-folder-mapping) below).

---

## Phase 0 Minimal Setup — What to Create (Step by Step)

Phase 0 is **not** the full course structure. It is one public repo, **five files with real content**, and a short Git workflow.

### What you create on GitHub

1. A **public** personal repository (not the teacher course repo).
2. Repository name: `student-portfolio` **or** `student-name-full-stack-ai-portfolio` (example: `morgan-full-stack-ai-portfolio`).

### The five required files

| File | Required content |
|---|---|
| `README.md` | Your repo homepage. Copy from `03_Templates/student-root-README-template.md` and fill in your name, grade, course, learning goals, and project table (status can be "Not Started"). Link placeholders are fine in Phase 0. |
| `.gitignore` | Exclude files that must never be uploaded. See [What Not to Upload](#what-not-to-upload) below for the recommended list. |
| `profile/about-me.md` | Short introduction: name, grade, CS/AI interests, why you are taking this course. |
| `profile/learning-goals.md` | 3–5 specific goals for this semester (Git, portfolio, full-stack, AI apps, etc.). |
| `reflections/weekly-reflection-01.md` | Your first weekly reflection. Use `03_Templates/weekly-reflection-template.md` as a guide. Write in your own words. |

You do **not** need `ai-literacy/`, `nextjs-frontend/`, `final-ai-app/`, or other phase folders in Phase 0. Add those when you reach each phase.

### Git workflow you must complete

| Step | Action |
|---|---|
| 1 | Create the repository |
| 2 | Add all five files above |
| 3 | Make at least one commit (multiple meaningful commits are better) |
| 4 | Create a branch named `update-profile` |
| 5 | Edit `README.md` on that branch (e.g. expand About Me or update the project table) |
| 6 | Open a pull request (`update-profile` → `main`) |
| 7 | Merge the pull request |
| 8 | Submit your repository URL to your teacher |

This proves you can use: repository, README, commit, branch, pull request, merge, and basic organization.

### Phase 0 vs full scaffold (do not confuse these)

Your teacher may suggest creating **empty** folders early (`ai-literacy/`, `final-ai-app/`, etc.). That is **optional** scaffolding.

The **Phase 0 pass requirement** in this guide is only the five files and the Git workflow above. Empty folders alone are not enough.

---

## Phase 0 — Three-Lesson Checklist

Use this if your class runs Phase 0 over three lessons. Each lesson adds concrete deliverables.

### After Lesson 1: Markdown and Your First Repo

**Goal:** Repository exists with a readable homepage.

- [ ] GitHub account ready (if needed)
- [ ] Public repo created with the correct name
- [ ] `README.md` added from `student-root-README-template.md`
- [ ] README includes: your name, grade, course name, and at least one learning goal
- [ ] At least one commit pushed to GitHub
- [ ] You can explain: course repo vs student repo

**Repo state after Lesson 1:**

```text
student-portfolio/
└── README.md
```

### After Lesson 2: Commits and Git Workflow

**Goal:** Profile and reflection files exist; commits show real progress.

- [ ] `.gitignore` added (recommended list in [What Not to Upload](#what-not-to-upload))
- [ ] `profile/about-me.md` written (not empty)
- [ ] `profile/learning-goals.md` written (not empty)
- [ ] `reflections/weekly-reflection-01.md` written (not empty)
- [ ] Multiple commits with clear messages (e.g. "Add profile folder", "Add weekly reflection")
- [ ] All changes pushed to GitHub
- [ ] You can explain what a commit is and why `.gitignore` matters

**Repo state after Lesson 2:**

```text
student-portfolio/
├── README.md
├── .gitignore
├── profile/
│   ├── about-me.md
│   └── learning-goals.md
└── reflections/
    └── weekly-reflection-01.md
```

### After Lesson 3: Branch, Pull Request, and Phase 0 Capstone

**Goal:** Phase 0 Final GitHub Task complete; repo link submitted.

- [ ] Branch `update-profile` created
- [ ] `README.md` updated on that branch
- [ ] Pull request opened and merged into `main`
- [ ] [Student GitHub Submission Checklist](#student-github-submission-checklist) completed
- [ ] Repository URL submitted to teacher
- [ ] You can explain what a pull request is and why branches are useful

**Optional before Phase 2:** create an empty `ai-literacy/` folder if your teacher asks you to prepare early.

---

## Full Target Repository Structure

This is the **final target structure** for the whole course.

You should **not** create every folder immediately unless your teacher asks you to. Add folders gradually when you reach each phase:

- Add `ai-literacy/` when starting AI Literacy.
- Add `ai-math-bridge/` when starting AI Math Bridge.
- Add `figma-design/` when starting Figma.
- Add `typescript-practice/` when starting TypeScript.
- Add `nextjs-frontend/` when starting Next.js.
- Add `fastapi-backend/` when starting FastAPI.
- Add `full-stack-mini-project/` when starting the full-stack mini project.
- Add `final-ai-app/` when starting the final project.

## Practice Folders vs Project Folders

Some folders are for **skill practice** — learning evidence, small labs, notes, and screenshots:

```text
ai-literacy/
ai-math-bridge/
figma-design/
typescript-practice/
nextjs-frontend/
fastapi-backend/
```

Some folders are for **complete projects** — frontend, backend, design, docs, and reflection together:

```text
full-stack-mini-project/
final-ai-app/
```

**Rule:**

```text
Practice work goes into skill folders.
Complete projects go into project folders.
Do not split one complete project randomly across many unrelated folders.
```

Examples:

- A small Next.js practice page → `nextjs-frontend/`
- A complete app with frontend and backend → `full-stack-mini-project/` or `final-ai-app/`

---

## Phase to Folder Mapping

| Phase | Folder | Required Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Phase 0: GitHub Setup | `README.md`, `profile/`, `reflections/` | Repo link, README, one branch, one PR |
| Phase 1: Notion Portfolio | Root `README.md` | Notion portfolio link |
| Phase 2: AI Literacy | `ai-literacy/` | AI reflection, responsible AI notes, ethics case study |
| Phase 3: AI Math Bridge | `ai-math-bridge/` | Vector notes, matrix notes, NumPy lab, image-as-matrix lab |
| Phase 4: Figma Design | `figma-design/` | Figma link, screenshots, design reflection |
| Phase 5: TypeScript Basics | `typescript-practice/` | `types.ts`, `api-types.ts`, README |
| Phase 6: Next.js Frontend | `nextjs-frontend/` | Frontend explanation, screenshots, deployment link if available |
| Phase 7: FastAPI Backend | `fastapi-backend/` | API docs, Swagger UI screenshots, setup notes |
| Phase 8/9: Full-Stack Mini Project | `full-stack-mini-project/` | Frontend, backend, screenshots, API connection explanation |
| Final Phase: AI App Project | `final-ai-app/` | Complete project, demo link, README, reflection |
| Ongoing | `certificates/`, `reflections/` | Certificates, weekly reflections, Cursor reflection |

## Phase 0 Final GitHub Task

By the end of **Phase 0**, you must:

1. Create a personal GitHub repository.
2. Name it `student-portfolio` or `student-name-full-stack-ai-portfolio`.
3. Add a root `README.md` using the template above.
4. Add a basic `.gitignore`.
5. Create the minimum Phase 0 folder structure:
   - `profile/about-me.md`
   - `profile/learning-goals.md`
   - `reflections/weekly-reflection-01.md`
6. Make at least one commit.
7. Create a branch called `update-profile`.
8. Edit `README.md` on that branch.
9. Open a pull request.
10. Merge the pull request.
11. Submit the GitHub repository link to your teacher.

This proves you can use: repository, README, commit, branch, pull request, merge, and GitHub project organization.

## What Not to Upload

Never commit:

```text
node_modules/
.venv/
__pycache__/
.env
.env.local
API keys
passwords
large unnecessary files
```

Recommended `.gitignore` for your student repo:

```gitignore
node_modules/
.next/
.venv/
__pycache__/
*.pyc
.env
.env.local
.DS_Store
```

API keys and passwords must **never** be committed to GitHub.

---

## Student Privacy and School Data Safety

Do not upload private or sensitive information to GitHub.

**Do not upload:**

- real student grades
- private student names from school records
- private school documents
- screenshots containing student personal information
- screenshots of private chats or emails
- API keys, passwords, or `.env` files
- private database files
- any file the school has not approved for public sharing

Use **sample data** instead of real school data.

Good examples:

```text
Student A
Student B
Sample Course 1
Sample Score 85
```

Bad examples:

```text
real student full names
real grade reports
real parent emails
private school documents
```

```text
When in doubt, do not upload it.
Ask the teacher before publishing anything related to real people or school information.
```

---

## Student GitHub Submission Checklist

Before submitting your repository link after **Phase 0**, check:

- [ ] My repository has a clear name.
- [ ] My root README.md is complete.
- [ ] My minimum Phase 0 folders are complete.
- [ ] I have made multiple commits.
- [ ] I have used at least one branch.
- [ ] I have opened and merged at least one pull request.
- [ ] My reflections are written in my own words.
- [ ] I did not upload API keys, passwords, `.env` files, or `node_modules`.
- [ ] I did not upload real student data or private school information.
- [ ] I understand that more folders will be added later as the course progresses.

As the course continues, also check:

- [ ] My project folders include README files when I add them.
- [ ] My screenshots are included where needed.
- [ ] My Notion portfolio link is in my root README.
- [ ] My final project link is included when available.

## How This Fits the Course

```text
Phase 0           = minimum repo setup
Whole course      = full target structure (added gradually)
Practice folders  = learning evidence
Project folders   = complete apps
GitHub            = technical process and history
Notion            = public portfolio showcase
```

```text
Teacher course repository   →  lessons, templates, rubrics, starter code
Student personal repository →  your evidence, projects, reflections, code
Notion portfolio            →  public showcase of your best work
GitHub repository           →  proof of your technical process and history
```

The course repo tells you **what to do**. Your student repo shows **what you did**.

**Keep evidence organized.** Use GitHub as proof of your learning process. Use Notion as your public showcase.
